## Overview

FinAudit-AI seeks to modernize the audit process by automating repetitive tasks, flagging risks proactively, and ensuring compliance with industry standards. The platform supports both auditors and auditees with guided workflows, secure document handling, and real-time AI insights.

- **For Auditors:** AI-assisted testing, smart sampling, anomaly detection, historical insights, and compliance validation.
- **For Auditees:** Easy onboarding, automated document validation, real-time notifications, and compliance-ready evidence management.

---

## Core Features

- **Audit Planning & Creation:** Define audit scope, assign teams, set deadlines, and categorize risk.
- **AI-Powered Sampling:** Automatically suggest high-risk documents for review.
- **Document Submission Portal:** Secure, guided, and bulk uploads with metadata tagging and automated checks.
- **Automated Validation:** OCR, integrity checks (SHA-256), tamper detection, and completeness validation.
- **AI-Assisted Testing:** Anomaly detection, compliance checks, pattern recognition, and NLP-powered search.
- **Findings & Corrective Actions:** Severity-based findings, automated notifications, evidence upload, and tracking of resolution.
- **Reporting:** Auto-generated PDF/Excel audit reports, visual dashboards, and compliance scores.
- **Audit Trail & Version Control:** Immutable logs, blockchain/WORM storage, and revision history.
- **Security & Compliance:** Encryption, secure access, and industry-standard frameworks (SOX, GAAP, GDPR).
- **User Experience:** Real-time notifications, guided onboarding, and intuitive dashboards.

## Workflow

1. **Audit Initiation**
   - Onboard auditees and auditors.
   - Define scope, deadlines, and risk categories.

2. **Document Requests**
   - Manual and AI-suggested sampling.
   - Auditees receive notifications and upload required documents.

3. **Submission & Validation**
   - Guided upload wizard, bulk uploads, and auto-validation.
   - Real-time feedback on missing or incorrect files.

4. **AI-Assisted Audit Testing**
   - Anomaly detection, compliance validation, side-by-side document comparison.
   - NLP search and automated findings.

5. **Findings & Actions**
   - Log and assign findings by severity.
   - Auditees respond with corrective actions and evidence.

6. **Reporting & Closure**
   - Auto-generated reports and dashboards.
   - Final audit closure and secure archival.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript (modern dashboards, upload portal, notifications)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), modular microservices for audit, findings, document processing, and AI integrations.
- **AI Engines:** Integrations with Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenAI, Grok AI for document analysis and smart recommendations.
- **Storage:** Secure, encrypted, immutable document storage (WORM/blockchain).
- **Database:** Relational models for users, audits, findings, documents, and workflow states.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), SQLAlchemy
- **AI Services:** Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenAI, Grok AI
- **OCR & Document Processing:** Tesseract, PDF/CSV parsing
- **Security:** SHA-256, Encryption, Blockchain/WORM storage
- **Other:** Docker, Vercel, Postgres

---

## How It Works

- **Onboarding:** Auditees and auditors are invited via email; permissions and roles are assigned.
- **Audit Creation:** Auditors create audits, define scope, and set deadlines.
- **Document Handling:** Auditees upload documents, which are auto-validated and processed by AI for anomalies and compliance issues.
- **Findings & Insights:** AI and manual findings are logged, tracked, and visualized; auditees can respond and resolve issues.
- **Reporting:** Final reports are generated automatically, including evidence links and compliance scores.
- **Archival:** All documents and logs are securely stored for future reference and regulatory compliance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for frontend)
- Python 3.8+ (for backend)
- Docker (recommended for deployment)
- Postgres database

### Installation

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Database:**
- Setup Postgres and update connection settings in `backend/app/config.py`

**Docker:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Configuration
