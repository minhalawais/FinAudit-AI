Step-by-Step Audit Workflow (Auditee Perspective)
Your software automates and simplifies the audit process for auditees (companies being audited). Here’s how it works:

1. Auditee Onboarding & Auditor Assignment
The auditee (company admin) signs up and logs into the system.

They add an auditor by:

Entering the auditor’s email.

The system auto-generates a temporary password and sends it to the auditor.

The auditor receives an email with login credentials and a link to access the Auditor Portal.

The auditee can assign permissions (e.g., view-only, submit requests, approve findings).

2. Audit Creation (Auditee or Auditor)
The auditor (or sometimes the auditee) creates a new audit:

Defines scope (e.g., "Q3 2024 Vendor Payments > $10K").

Sets a deadline for document submission.

The system auto-schedules a Kickoff Meeting (48 hours later) with both parties.

3. Document Request & Submission (Auditee’s Responsibility)
The auditor (or system AI) requests documents (e.g., invoices, receipts, contracts).

The auditee receives notifications (email + dashboard alert) with:

A list of required documents.

Deadlines for submission.

Metadata requirements (e.g., vendor name, date, amount).

The auditee uploads documents via:

Guided Upload Wizard (ensures correct format, metadata, and signatures).

Drag-and-drop for bulk uploads (PDFs, CSV files).

Auto-validation (checks for tampering, missing fields).

4. Automated Document Validation (System Checks)
The system performs:

SHA-256 Hash Check (ensures no tampering).

Metadata Completeness Check (flags missing fields).

OCR & Data Extraction (for automated analysis).

If issues are found:

The auditee gets real-time feedback (e.g., "Missing approval signature").

They can resubmit corrected documents before the deadline.

5. AI-Assisted Audit Testing (Auditor’s Role)
The auditor reviews documents in their portal:

AI flags anomalies (e.g., duplicate invoices, mismatched amounts).

Side-by-side comparison (e.g., invoice vs. payment record).

1-Click Meeting Request if urgent issues arise.

The auditee is notified if findings require their response.

6. Findings & Corrective Actions
The auditor logs findings (Critical/Major/Minor):

Critical (24h resolution): Auto-notifies executives.

Major (72h resolution): Assigned to department heads.

Minor (7d resolution): Team lead follow-up.

The auditee can:

Respond to findings (upload corrective evidence).

Request extensions if needed.

Track progress in their dashboard.

7. Exit Conference & Report Generation
The system auto-schedules an Exit Meeting:

Presents final findings.

Discusses corrective action plans.

The auditee receives a Final Audit Report (PDF/Excel):

Clickable links to source documents.

Visual timeline of audit milestones.

Compliance score (for internal review).

8. Follow-Up & Audit Closure
The system tracks corrective actions:

Sends reminders for overdue items.

Auto-escalates unresolved issues.

Once resolved:

The audit is marked "Closed".

Documents are archived in WORM storage (immutable for compliance).

How the Document Module is Already Integrated
Your existing Document Module (from FYP 1) provides the foundation:

Document Upload & OCR: Auditees can upload PDFs/CSVs, and text is extracted automatically.

Version Control: All revisions are tracked; no documents are lost.

Secure Storage: Encryption + blockchain for tamper-proofing.

Search & Retrieval: Auditors can quickly find documents by metadata.
