Core Workflow (Document-Centric Audit Process)
Step 1: Audit Planning
Audit Creation

Auditors define scope (e.g., "Q3 2024 Expense Reports").

Assign auditees (teams/users who will upload documents).

Set deadlines and risk categories (e.g., "High Risk: Vendor Payments").

AI-Powered Sampling Requests

Auditors request documents via:

Manual Selection: Specify filenames/categories.

AI Suggestions: System flags high-risk files (e.g., invoices > $10K).

Step 2: Document Submission by Auditee
Upload Portal

Auditees upload requested files (PDF invoices, CSV ledgers, receipt images).

Metadata tagging (e.g., "Vendor: XYZ", "Fiscal Year: 2024").

Automated Validation

File integrity checks (e.g., no tampering).

OCR for text extraction (to enable search/AI analysis).

Step 3: AI-Assisted Audit Testing
Key Features:

Anomaly Detection

Flags inconsistencies (e.g., mismatched amounts in CSV vs. PDF).

Compliance Checks

Validates against rules (e.g., "All invoices > $5K require approval").

Pattern Recognition

Identifies duplicates or unusual trends (e.g., repeated payments to a vendor).

Auditor Tools:

Document Comparison: Side-by-side view of similar files.

Search with NLP: Queries like "Show non-compliant expense reports."

Step 4: Findings & Reporting
Auditor Workflow:

Review AI-generated flags.

Add manual findings (e.g., "Missing signature on Invoice #123").

Assign severity (Critical/Major/Minor).

Auto-Generated Reports

PDF/Excel: Summary of findings, evidence links, and recommendations.

Dashboard: Visual trends (e.g., "80% of errors are from Vendor A").

Step 5: Follow-Up & Resolution
Auditees respond to findings within the system (upload corrected files or comments).

Audit trail logs all actions (who reviewed/resolved what).
